SQL files contains queries on Google Big Query for their Bitcoin blockchain data.
Downloading the table generated on a local system (by multiple parquest files), the Python files queries these tables via DuckDB to analyze Bitcoin in and outflow from cyptoexchanges.
Next step is to setup a node via Bitcoin Core and setup BitcoinETL to streamline blockchain data directly through the peer to peer network rather than through Google Big Query (reduce cost).
